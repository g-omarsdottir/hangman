    Welcome to a game of Hangman!
        
    You will get a set of blanks representing the number of letters in a word.
    Guess the word by entering one letter at a time and press enter.
            
    If you guess correctly, your letter(s) will appear on the blank(s).
            
    With each incorrect guess, one element will be added to the stick figure
    on the gallows, so choose wisely. 
            
    After 6 incorrect guesses, the stick figure is complete and itâ€™s game over.
            
    Let the games begin!
