# Welcome to a game of Hangman

Mockup

Link to Live Project

This hangman game is an online command-line implementation of the classic word-guessing game Hangman, which is traditionally played with pen and paper. It is designed to test and train vocabulary and deductive skills in a playful way.

The word to guess is randomly generated from a list of animals for a fresh challenge each time. The number of wrong guesses is limited to the number of lines it takes to draw the hangman stick figure on the gallows. When the stick figure is complete, the stick figure is hanged and the game ends. If the word puzzle is solved before the stick figure hangs, the player wins and successfully completes game.

## Project and Site Owner Goals

Create a fun retro game using my acquired Pythons skills.
- Core Python Programming: Effective use of Python's data types, variables, operators, and syntax.
- Problem-Solving: Design a solution to break down the game logic into well-defined steps.
- Control Flow: Implement conditional statements (if, elif, else) and loops (for, while) to manage the game's progression.
- Functions: Create modular and reusable code blocks with functions encapsulating specific game mechanics. The goal is for each function to handle a single, well-defined task. This approach promotes cleaner code, easier maintainability and readability, and easier debugging during testing.
- User Interaction: Design a command-line interface to gather user input and provide user feedback.

- [Chris Horton](https://gist.github.com/chrishorton/8510732aa9a80a03c829b09f12e20d9c) for the hangman image and the words to guess.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50504500/deprecationwarning-invalid-escape-sequence-what-to-use-instead-of-d) for declaration of a raw string for the hangman drawing. Adding an escape character "\" for each problem makes the the drawing, which is is created with characters, less readable.
