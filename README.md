### Content

- [Chris Horton](https://gist.github.com/chrishorton/8510732aa9a80a03c829b09f12e20d9c) for the hangman image and the words to guess.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50504500/deprecationwarning-invalid-escape-sequence-what-to-use-instead-of-d) for declaration of a raw string for the hangman drawing. Adding an escape character "\" for each problem makes the the drawing, which is is created with characters, less readable.
